# Katakerm
Originally written in Java as the key derivation algorithm of a cipher I work on, katakerm has the core properties of cryptographic hash functions.

A 256-bit output is produced for every input, as every byte of it
is cascaded onto every other, and retrieving the original input is computationally impossible due to the combination of successive xors of the content bytes with each other, and with the results of trigonometric functions and multiplications on intermediate long integers.

#### Assumptions
1. The byte ordering is assumed to be **little endian**.
2. All chars and numbers are assumed to be **signed**.
3. The rounding mode of decimal operations is assumed to be the default (equivalent to Java's HALF_UP)
4. All doubles are rounded to **exactly 12** decimal values before being used in any calculation.

If any of those is not met, the algorithm can and will yield different keys than meant to.


### The algorithm
A verbal description of the algorithm follows.

1. If the given input is shorter than 32bytes, it is copied to a 32byte array as is
and padded with zeros. If it is exactly 32 bytes, it is hashed as is. If longer than 32 bytes:
<br>a. The first 32bytes are hashed as they are, let A the result.
<br>b. For every next Nth part  of 32 bytes, let P, every 8 bytes of A are used to
deduce signed longs, multiplied respectively by N, 4 * N, 9 * N, and 16 * N, let the results H,J,K,L respectively. 
All bytes of P are xored with the corresponding byte of A, as well as with the mod 255 of 
their exact position in the input. The results are in turn converted to unsigned long integers, and multiplied by H,J,K,L respectively. The results are XORed with A and stored into M. 
<br>c. The last remaining mod32 bytes, if any, are xored onto M as they are.
The result M is hereby used as the input.

2) The original input length L used to deduce an xor-operation value X as follows:
<br>for any input of length L <= 127, X=L.
<br>Otherwise, X = L mod 128. If zero, then X = 127

3. A two-dimensional array 4x8 is created, and populated with the contents of M xored with the value X, and the multiply of the respective position (e.g. 3*2 for the element [3][2], element count starting from 1 instead of 0). All bytes in the array besides the first, are xored with the previous one. At the end, the first byte of the array is xored with the last byte. Let T the result.

4. The four 8-byte rows of T are treated as four signed long integer numbers, let Q,W,E,R. We deduce two doubles A,B as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A = cos(Q) + sin (W+E)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B = cos(W+E) + sin(R)
They are then treated as simple 8-byte arrays for XOR operations.

5. A one-dimensional byte array K of length four is deduced as follows
<br>for every j âˆˆ [1,4], K[j] = T[j][1] XOR T[j][2] XOR T[j][7] XOR T[j][8]
	
6. We define the following:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V = K[1] treated as signed long. If zero, V=1.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B = K[2]^2 treated as long. If zero, V=2.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N = K[3]^3 treated as long. If zero, V=4.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M = K[4]^4 treated as long. If zero, V=27.
    <br>Let  V * B * N * M, a 64bit signed long treated as a byte array Z.
    <br>Every byte of Z is XORED with the respective byte of A and B
    and stored in Z.

7. key[i][j] = T[i][j] XOR Z[j] XOR (i * i * i AND 0XFF)
<br>

The result is guaranteed to change drastically for any modification of the input, and it 
is impossible to deduce the original input from an output.

This was originally a key derivation algorithm, but having some of the properties of hash functions, it may be used as such too.  

It is important to note that the percentage of existent 256bit combinations that are possible through it, is uncertain. The inputs may (or may not) be manipulated to produce
identical digests, if someone finds a weakness in the algorithm. Yet no collisions were noted for repeated automated tests of up to 50m randomly generated input strings and numbers.
